## Troubleshooting

**Problem: "Windows protected your PC" message**
- Click "More info" â†’ "Run anyway"
- This happens because the executable isn't digitally signed

**Problem: Antivirus blocks the file**
- Add `cimb-ecr.exe` to your antivirus whitelist
- This is common with PyInstaller-generated executables

**Problem: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"**
- Make sure `cimb-ecr.exe` is running (command prompt window should be open)
- Check the URL is exactly: `http://localhost:5001`
